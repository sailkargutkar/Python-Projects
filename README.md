# Random Forest Model of US 2016 Presidential Election

This repo contains annotated Jupyter notebooks that walk through the creation of several predictive models of the 2016 US presidential election based on county-level socio-economic features. These notebooks outline the data wrangling process using Python and Pandas, as well as using the scikit-learn machine learning library to build, optimize, and evaluate models of the data including k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, and random forests. This model is used to power the interactive data visualization here: https://kkehoe1985.github.io/2016_election_data_viz/

This repo also contains several initialization files used by the visualization.
