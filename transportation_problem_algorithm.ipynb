Dijkstra's Algorithm stands out from the rest due to its ability to find the shortest path from one node to every other node within the same graph data structure. One algorithm for finding the shortest path from a starting node to a target node in a weighted graph is Dijkstra's algorithm. The algorithm creates a tree of shortest paths from the starting vertex, the source, to all other points in the graph. Dijkstra's algorithm is just BFS with a priority queue. Dijkstra's algorithm is used for graph searches. It is optimal, meaning it will find the single shortest path. It is uninformed, meaning it does not need to know the target node beforehand. In fact it finds the shortest path from every node to the node of origin."

        "Basically we have used greedy algorithm to find the shortest routes, Greedy is an algorithmic paradigm that builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most obvious and immediate benefit. So the problems where choosing locally optimal also leads to global solution are best fit for Greedy. For example consider the Fractional Knapsack Problem\n",
        "we have tried Genetic Algorithms & Ant Colony Optimisation algorithms also as per suggested, But those algorithms took too much time to learn. At the end we discuss and decide to develop our own model with the help of greedy algorithms.\n",
        "Route optimization is the process of determining the shortest possible routes to reach a location. This methodology has gained popularity in the transport and logistics industry. Since it reduces the time spent traveling and at the same time reduces the incurred cost in the process.\n",
        "\n",
        "Before a company or an organization can employ this strategy, it has to first be able to document all of its routes of business after which experts can then use the provided data to predict the best possible routes.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the course of determining the best possible routes, there is usually a simulation of different scenarios. And ever since route optimization has gone digital with lots of software available today, the prediction of these routes is now done using the route optimization algorithm.\n",
        "\n",
        "To solve an optimization problem, begin by drawing a picture and introducing variables. Find an equation relating the variables. Find a function of one variable to describe the quantity that is to be minimized or maximized. Look for critical points to locate local extrema.\n",
        "\n",
        "To better appreciate and understand what route optimization algorithm is expected to solve, knowledge of vehicle routing problem is important.\n",
